- 👋 Hi, I’m @MMartin1211
- 👀 I’m interested in ecology and nature, and especially environmental conservation, restoration, and reclamation. I am also interested in GIS, particularly environmental applications of GIS. My hobbies include reefkeeping, video games, and playing with my 2 kids.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GIS and python. I'm in the final semester of my Master's program for GIS and have taken a class on using python with GIS, but I would like to further expand my python coding knowledge and experience.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... not sure yet.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
